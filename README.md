# Blender CG Project

This project is for a Computer Graphics Subject on College (IFCE - BR)

It is a car concept to be modeled and animated throughout the semester

## How to contribute to the project

First, obviously, you have to install these tools and follow the steps that are on the sites ahead

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
-   [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)

To verify if it is installed just go to your shell and type (For Blender, just open it)

`git --version`

`git lfs --version`

Once o clone this repository, going into the directory which it is in and

`git lfs install --local`

### Why use Git Large File Storage

Because git has great control above binary files but not when is working with a larger binary files, so Git LFS make another pointers to get to your repository only the thing that you are working on and not have do pull every single commit of a large file that was modified (Those pointer works like a commit but always pointing to the large binary file, making your repo has a lot of pointer instead of a lot of binary larger files, leading to a smaller sized repo)
