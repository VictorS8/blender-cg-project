# Stages of this project

## 1. Beetle's skeleton

First we made the beetle's skeleton to make it easy to modeling and divide each part to the three members of the group, screenshot of skeleton below

## 2. Beetle's modeling

When modeling the beetle, we began with just a mesh plane

We add some modifier to help on modelling each side of the car, thickness and roundness
